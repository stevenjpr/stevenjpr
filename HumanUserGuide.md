## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* *Tell us about things that others may not easily discern about you.*

I'm one of those people with way too many hobbies.  
*  The good news: I'm never bored.  I don't think I've been bored for a minute of a day in my life.  
*  The bad news: I never have the time that I'd to be able to spend on all of them.
  
Outside of work, my primary hobby is sailing.  I keep a boat in Seattle and love nothing more than being on the water on a warm day.

Gaming is not one of my hobbies.  On the surface that seems odd for the line of work that I'm in.  But even though I don't enjoy playing games, I'm fascinated by the technology and the platforms required to build one.  

My favorite person is a 6 year old Alaskan Malamute.
